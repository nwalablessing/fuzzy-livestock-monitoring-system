Fuzzy Logic Model for Monitoring Livestock Farming
This project presents an intelligent livestock monitoring system using fuzzy logic to enhance animal welfare and reduce exploitation in factory farming environments. The system was designed and implemented as part of a Master’s thesis in Computer Science at the University of Port Harcourt.

The fuzzy-based model improves upon existing monitoring approaches by using a combination of calibrated data, rule-based inference, and sensor logic to detect abnormal livestock conditions. The system was implemented using Python for backend logic and MySQL for data handling. Compared to traditional measurement methods (with 59% accuracy), the proposed model achieved 89% accuracy using a confusion matrix and ROC curve for evaluation.

The software architecture includes a knowledge base, inference engine, and visualization dashboard, enabling better interpretation of livestock health and movement patterns. The project adopted a Waterfall methodology, and all modules — from system design to dataflow diagrams and UML — are documented.
